Git Tag Ops. Turn your Git repository into an Artifact Registry:

- Registry: Track new artifacts and their versions for releases and significant
  changes.
- Lifecycle Management: Create actionable stages for versions marking status of
  artifact or it's readiness to be consumed by a specific environment.
- GitOps: Signal CI/CD automation or other downstream systems to act upon these
  new versions and lifecycle updates.
- Enrichments: Annotate and query artifact metadata with additional information.

GTO works by creating annotated Git tags in a standard format.

## Installation

GTO requires Python 3. It works on any OS.

```console
$ pip install gto
```

This will install the `gto`
[command-line interface](https://mlem.ai/doc/gto/command-reference) (CLI) and
make the Python API available for use in code.

## Getting started

To Get Started, please head to [GTO docs](https://mlem.ai/doc/gto/get-started).

How to setup GTO development environment

1. Clone this repository

```console
$ git clone git@github.com:iterative/gto.git
$ cd gto
```

2. Create virtual environment named `venv`

```console
$ python3 -m venv .venv
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

Install python libraries

```console
$ pip install --upgrade pip ".[tests]"
```

3. Run

```console
$ pytest --basetemp=pytest-basetemp
```

This will create `pytest-basetemp/` directory with some fixtures that can serve
as examples.

Notably, check out this dir:

```console
$ cd pytest-basetemp/test_api0/
$ gto show -v
```

The code that generates this folder could be found
[in this fixture](https://github.com/iterative/gto/blob/main/tests/conftest.py#L58).

To continue experimenting, call `gto --help`
